# Project: The Impact of Social Media on Stock Prices

Twitter, as one of the most popular social media platforms, has been considered as an influential factor to the stock market by many professional publications recently. The purpose of this study is to perform a deeper analysis and research about stock and twitter data. The approach combines hypothesis testing with machine learning. So, it could be used to evaluate the accuracy of Twitter usersâ€™ prediction (which will be indicated by the sentiment score in their tweets) of stock prices. With machine learning, we are able to separate users into correct prediction and incorrect prediction. From the two separated groups, the additional analysis on the influential factors in predicting stock price of twitter users could be revealed.
